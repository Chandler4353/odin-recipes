    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These turkey enchiladas are a great way to use leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Serve with sour cream and refried beans if desired.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend</li>
            <li>1 (19 ounce) can red enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (2 ounce) can sliced black olives</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil, divided, or more as needed</li>
            <li>24 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked turkey, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine Cheddar-Jack cheese, onion, and black olives in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Brush a small skillet with enough oil to coat a tortilla, and heat over low heat. Add tortilla and cook until soft, 15 to 30 seconds per side. Remove and dip in enchilada sauce to coat, then place on a plate. Place some turkey amd some cheese mixture in the center of the tortilla, roll up, and place it in the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Repeat Step 3, using more oil as needed, to form and roll 11 more enchiladas; they should cover the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Spread enchilada sauce over the enchiladas to cover. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to form, roll, and place remaining 12 enchiladas. Spread remaining sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
